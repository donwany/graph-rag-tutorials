This innovative method enhances both privacy and security by allowing data to stay on the devices where it is generated, rather than being centralized in a single location. By leveraging the computational power of various devices, federated learning facilitates collaborative model training without compromising sensitive information, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data privacy is paramount.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 88, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 283, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
