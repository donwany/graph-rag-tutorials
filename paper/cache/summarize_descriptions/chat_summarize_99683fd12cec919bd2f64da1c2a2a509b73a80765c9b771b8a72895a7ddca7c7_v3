It is a critical stage in the lifecycle of a machine learning model, particularly for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). During deployment, the model transitions from a development phase to an operational state, where it becomes available for specific applications. This process ensures that the model can effectively serve its intended purpose, providing users with the functionality and performance expected in real-world scenarios.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 95, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 276, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
