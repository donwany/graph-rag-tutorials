It involves the systematic elimination of unnecessary components, which serves to enhance both the efficiency and performance of these models. By focusing on the removal of less significant weights, pruning acts as an optimization strategy that reduces the complexity and size of the model without compromising its overall performance. This technique is essential for streamlining AI models, making them more manageable and faster while still retaining their effectiveness in various applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 104, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 293, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
