This method involves gradually decreasing the learning rate over time, which can enhance the model's performance and improve convergence. By modifying the learning rate, learning rate scheduling helps to optimize the training process, allowing models to learn more effectively and efficiently. This approach is particularly beneficial in preventing overshooting during optimization and can lead to better overall results in model training.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 89, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 270, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
