This inadequacy leads to suboptimal performance, as the model is unable to learn from the data effectively. A key indicator of underfitting is a high loss value that remains relatively unchanged, indicating that the model is not improving its understanding of the data over time. Consequently, underfitting results in a model that lacks the complexity necessary to make accurate predictions, ultimately hindering its effectiveness in real-world applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 111, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
