These parameters play a significant role in controlling the training process of machine learning models. By influencing various aspects of the training, hyperparameters directly affect the performance and effectiveness of the models being developed. Their proper selection and tuning are essential for optimizing model outcomes, making them a fundamental consideration in the design and implementation of machine learning algorithms.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 93, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 282, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
