This method is crucial for ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data rather than merely fitting the training data too closely. By monitoring the validation performance, early stopping allows practitioners to identify the optimal point to cease training, thereby maintaining a balance between model complexity and performance. This approach is widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing the robustness of machine learning models.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 248, "total_tokens": 356, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
