This library enables developers to fine-tune their models while ensuring that the confidentiality of the underlying data is maintained. By integrating built-in support for differential privacy, TensorFlow Privacy allows for the secure training of models, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed during the learning process. This makes it a valuable tool for developers who are looking to balance the need for effective machine learning with the imperative of protecting user data.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 305, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
