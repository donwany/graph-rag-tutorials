Fine-tuning is a method used to enhance WHISPER's performance by adapting it to specific ASR tasks and datasets. This process involves adjusting the model's parameters based on additional training data, allowing WHISPER to achieve improved accuracy and efficiency in recognizing and processing speech in various contexts. By undergoing fine-tuning, WHISPER becomes better equipped to handle the nuances of different speech patterns and environments, ultimately leading to superior performance in targeted applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 300, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
