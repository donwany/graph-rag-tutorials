This phenomenon can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models, leading to biased predictions. When a dataset exhibits data imbalance, models may become biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor generalization and accuracy for the minority class. Consequently, addressing data imbalance is crucial for developing robust and fair predictive models.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 83, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 266, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
