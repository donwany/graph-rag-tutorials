This approach allows models to leverage pre-existing knowledge, significantly enhancing their ability to adapt to new tasks with minimal additional training. By utilizing the insights gained from previous tasks, transfer learning facilitates more efficient learning processes, often resulting in improved performance and reduced training time for new applications. This technique is particularly valuable in scenarios where data for the new task is scarce, as it allows for the effective application of knowledge acquired from larger datasets associated with the original task.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 316, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
