By generating additional training examples from the existing data, these techniques help improve the robustness and accuracy of machine learning models. Data augmentation is particularly valuable in scenarios where obtaining new data is challenging or costly, allowing researchers and practitioners to leverage existing datasets more effectively. Overall, Data Augmentation plays a crucial role in the development of more reliable and efficient machine learning systems.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 98, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 274, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
