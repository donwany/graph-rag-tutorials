These models are built upon extensive datasets, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics. However, while LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation and understanding, they encounter significant challenges, particularly in sensitive domains where data privacy is of utmost importance. This duality highlights both the potential and the limitations of LLMs in practical applications, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and data handling practices in their deployment.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 118, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
