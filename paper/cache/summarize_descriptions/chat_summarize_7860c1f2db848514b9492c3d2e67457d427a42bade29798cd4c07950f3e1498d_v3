These models are trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks effectively. \n\nThe training process for LLMs involves the use of sophisticated techniques, including the application of cross-entropy as a loss function. This approach helps guide the models' predictions and enhances their overall performance in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. \n\nIn summary, LLMs are powerful AI tools that leverage vast amounts of data and complex algorithms to interpret and produce human-like text, making them invaluable in various applications across different fields.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 390, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
