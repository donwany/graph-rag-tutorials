It encompasses the curation and preparation of datasets, which are essential for effective model training. This stage is vital as it directly influences the performance and accuracy of the models being developed.\n\nThe data preparation process involves several key strategies, including data collection and the management of imbalanced datasets. Proper data collection ensures that the datasets used for training are representative and comprehensive, which is necessary for the model to learn effectively. Additionally, handling imbalanced datasets is crucial, as imbalances can lead to biased models that perform poorly on underrepresented classes.\n\nOverall, data preparation serves as the foundation for successful model fine-tuning, making it an indispensable part of the machine learning pipeline.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
