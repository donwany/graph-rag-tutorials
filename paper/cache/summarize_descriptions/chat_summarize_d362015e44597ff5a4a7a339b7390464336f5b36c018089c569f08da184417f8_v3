This process encompasses not only the establishment of initial parameters but also the configuration of the environment in which the model will operate. \n\nDuring Model Initialisation, various critical steps are undertaken, including the installation of necessary dependencies that are vital for the effective training of machine learning models. These dependencies may include libraries, frameworks, and tools that facilitate the model's functionality and performance. By ensuring that all required components are in place, Model Initialisation sets the stage for a smooth and efficient training process.\n\nIn summary, Model Initialisation is a comprehensive preparatory phase that involves configuring both the model's parameters and the operational environment, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are installed and ready for the training of machine learning models.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
