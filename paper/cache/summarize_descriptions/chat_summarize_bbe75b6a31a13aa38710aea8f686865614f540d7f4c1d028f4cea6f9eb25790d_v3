This method involves training a language model on a labeled dataset that is specifically designed for a particular task. By utilizing this tailored dataset, SFT enhances the model's ability to perform effectively in the designated area, ensuring that it can generate accurate and relevant outputs based on the provided inputs. Overall, Supervised Fine-tuning is a crucial technique for improving the capabilities of language models in various applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 315, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
