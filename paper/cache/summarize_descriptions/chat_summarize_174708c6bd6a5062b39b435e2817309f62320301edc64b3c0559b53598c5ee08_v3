This phenomenon occurs when a model becomes overly complex, effectively memorizing the training dataset rather than identifying the underlying patterns that would allow it to generalize to new, unseen data. As a result, while the model may demonstrate a decrease in training loss—indicating that it performs well on the data it was trained on—it often exhibits an increase in validation loss. This discrepancy highlights the model's inability to perform effectively on new data, as it fails to generalize beyond the specific examples it has memorized. Thus, overfitting represents a critical challenge in developing robust machine learning models, necessitating strategies to ensure that models maintain a balance between fitting the training data and generalizing to new inputs.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
