Its primary purpose is to minimize cost functions, which are essential for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. By doing so, Gradient Descent aims to identify the optimal parameters for a neural network, thereby enhancing its predictive accuracy.\n\nThe algorithm operates by iteratively adjusting the model parameters in response to the gradients of the loss function. This process involves calculating the gradient, or the derivative, of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. By moving in the direction of the negative gradient, Gradient Descent seeks to reduce the loss, effectively guiding the model towards a more optimal state.\n\nIn summary, Gradient Descent is a crucial technique in machine learning that facilitates the optimization of model parameters through iterative adjustments, ultimately leading to improved model performance by minimizing the loss function.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
