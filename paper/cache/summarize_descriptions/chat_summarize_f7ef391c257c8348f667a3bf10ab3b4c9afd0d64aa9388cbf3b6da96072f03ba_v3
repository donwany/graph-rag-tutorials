This approach enables real-time data analysis and fosters personalized user experiences by minimizing latency and enhancing responsiveness. By processing data near its source, edge computing significantly improves speed and efficiency, allowing for quicker decision-making and reduced bandwidth usage.\n\nThe core principle of edge computing is to bring computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, which contrasts with traditional models that rely on centralized data-processing warehouses. This decentralization not only optimizes performance but also supports a wide range of applications, particularly in environments where immediate data processing is critical, such as in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities.\n\nOverall, edge computing represents a shift towards more efficient data management and processing strategies, enabling organizations to leverage real-time insights and enhance user experiences while reducing the dependency on centralized cloud infrastructures.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 385, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
