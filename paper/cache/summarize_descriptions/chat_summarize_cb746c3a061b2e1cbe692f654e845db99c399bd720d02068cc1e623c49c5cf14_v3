GPUs play a crucial role in enhancing the training processes of deep learning models, especially large language models (LLMs). By leveraging their parallel processing capabilities, GPUs significantly speed up the complex calculations required for training these models, making them essential tools in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Their ability to handle multiple operations simultaneously allows for more efficient data processing, which is vital for the performance and scalability of deep learning applications.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "provider_specific_fields": {"refusal": null}, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 109, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
